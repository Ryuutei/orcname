Orc Name Generator
==================

First Ruby script.
My brother gave me his base of names. Maybe some references to WH (?).

Dependencies ?
--------------

- ruby 1.8.7 (maybe less...)

- nothing else.

Usage:
------

in a shell prompt type:

`orcname.rb`

If you want more suggestions from the output edit file orcname.rb and change the number at line 4.

`how = 999` for example.

That's all folks.
