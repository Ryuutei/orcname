Orc Name Generator
==================

First Ruby script.
My brother gave me his base of names. Maybe some references to WH (?).

Dependencies ?
--------------

- ruby 1.8.7 (maybe less...)

- nothing else.

Usage:
------

in a shell prompt type orcname.rb with the number of suggestions you want:

    âžœ  namegen_orc git:(master) orcname.rb 9
    Bggong Amuuk Rocksmasher
    Tmak Eggaoth Wolfkiller
    Ogoohong Mth Trolleater
    Ugguogang Aggour Tng Bearfang
    Z'guth Ehaoth Bearclaw
    Zggoth Uduuk Oduurth Orctooth
    M'hak Uggourth Eggaoth Rocksmasher
    Bharth Ohoath Rockclaw
    Adouggok Thrth Edaath Cavebone

That's all folks.
